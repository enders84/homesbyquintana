## üìù Understanding This Market Report

üìä **What is the HPI?**  
The California Housing Price Index (HPI) reflects how home prices have changed over time. Each data point shows the average home price trend for that year across California.  

üìà **Rising prices = Stronger market.**  
An increasing HPI typically means homes are appreciating in value, demand is strong, and sellers have leverage.  

üìâ **Falling prices = Cooling market.**  
When the HPI declines, it may reflect market corrections, rising interest rates, or changing buyer behavior.

üó∫ **How does this help you?**  
Even though this data reflects state-level averages, Rancho Cucamonga often follows similar trends. Understanding these shifts can help you plan your buying or selling strategy more effectively.
